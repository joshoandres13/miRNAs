# Introduction and Antecedents

## Overview of Hepatic Steatosis and Metabolic dysfunction- associated steatotic liver disease
Hepatic steatosis, defined by the excessive accumulation of triglycerides within hepatocytes, results from a wide range of factors that arising from nutritional and metabolic factors, including obesity, insulin resistence, and dysregulated lipid metabolism [@angulo2007obesity; @idilman2016hepatic]. This excessive accumulation of lipids triggers a harmful mechanism known as “lipotoxicity,” characterized by the toxic effects of lipid intermediates on hepatocytes, ultimately leading to cell apoptosis [@brankovic2022lipotoxicity]. Lipotoxicity is a critical driver in the progression of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) to metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) [@mary2024multisociety]. Furthermore, hepatic steatosis is a central feature of steatotic liver disease (SLD), which is categorized into two main subtypes: alcohol-related liver disease (ALD) and MASLD, the latter being the predominant form linked to metabolic dysfunction in the global population [@wong2024epidemiology].

MASLD and its more advanced form, metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), were previously known as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), respectively [@mary2024multisociety]. MASLD is diagnosed in adults who exhibit hepatic steatosis, identified through imaging techniques, blood biomarkers, or liver histology, in conjunction with being overweight or obese [@thyfault2020exercise], or in the presence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) or at least two metabolic risk abnormalities (hypertension, hyperlipidaemia or insulin resistance) [@chan2023metabolic; @younossi2019non]. Although in many cases it may be asymptomatic in its early stages, this condition can progress to more severe stages such as hepatocelular carcinoma (HCC), depending on its cause[@ma2024review]. It encompasses a spectrum of liver pathologies ranging from simple hepatic steatosis to metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), which is marked by lobular inflammation and hepatocellular ballooning, potentially progressing to fibrosis and cirrhosis, ultimately leading to liver failure [@sarwar2018obesity].

The prevalence of MASLD is affecting more than a third of the adult population worldwide, making it the most common chronic liver disease globally [@miao2024current]. Among adults, the prevalence (MASLD) is approximately 30% [@younossi2016global]. MASLD is particularly prevalent in overweight or obese individuals, with a global incidence of approximately 50%, rising to nearly 60% in individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2D) [@younossi2019global].

Over the last 30 years, the global prevalence of MASLD has experienced significant growth, rising from 17.6% in 1990 to 23.4% in 2019, reflecting an average annual increase of approximately 1.0%. As of 2019, it was estimated that there were around 1.66 billion prevalent cases of MASLD worldwide [@paik2023burden]. This condition is widespread, with the highest rates reported in South America (44%), Middle East East and North Africa (36%) and followed by South Asia (33%), South-East Asia (33%), North America and Australia (31%), East Asia (29%), Asia Paciﬁc regions (28%) and Western Europe (25%) [@younossi2016global; @younossi2023global] ([@fig-prevalence_younossi2023global]). Approximately one-quarter of the European population is affected by this liver disease [@younossi2019non]. In Europe, the prevalence of MASLD variates between countries ranging from 5% to 44% [@younossi2018global]. Data from Spain reflect similar rates, indicating a MASLD prevalence of 25% in the adult population [@caballeria2010prevalence].

This growing prevalence of MASLD is closely intertwined with the global rise in obesity and metabolic syndrome, conditions largely influenced by the complex interplay of adipose tissue function and dysfunction. Understanding the role of adipose tissue in metabolic regulation is therefore critical for elucidating the pathophysiology of MASLD.

## Role of Adipose Tissue in Metabolic Regulation
### Metabolic and Endocrine Functions of Adipose Tissue
Adipose tissue (AT) is a complex and dynamic organ with both metabolic and endocrine functions [@kershaw2004adipose]. It plays a pivotal role in energy balance, insulin sensitivity, immune responses and overall health [@rosen2014we]. Its role extends beyond simple fat storage, influencing whole-body physiology and contributing to various pathologies, notably obesity and its associated complications like MASLD [@cinti2007adipose].

### Types and Location of Adipose Tissue
Adipose tissue in mammals exists in three primary forms: white adipose tissue (WAT), brown adipose tissue (BAT), and beige or brite (brown-in-white) adipose tissue. Each type is distinguished by its unique functions and cellular composition [@zwick2018anatomical]. WAT primarily stores energy in the form of lipids, while BAT specializes in heat production through the uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation, a process critical for thermogenesis [@cinti2019anatomy]. Beige AT, a metabolically flexible tissue, can transition between energy storage and thermogenesis depending on physiological needs, highlighting its role in adaptive responses [@lopez2024unraveling] ([@fig-lopez2024unraveling]). The anatomical distribution of WAT further underscores its functional diversity.

WAT is classified into two major subtypes based its localization and function:

-   Subcutaneous white adipose tissue (scWAT), which constitutes over 80% of total body fat and serves as the primary site for long-term energy storage that its located beneath the skin, with its distribution and metabolic activity linked to protective effects on overall metabolic health [@ghesmati2024update].

-   Visceral white adipose tissue (visWAT), which accounts for 10–20% of total body fat in men and 5–10% in women, is more metabolically active, and is strongly associated with adverse health outcomes such as insulin resistance and inflammation. visWAT is located surrounding internal organs such as the liver and intestines [@ghesmati2024update; @jialal2018subcutaneous; @ibrahim2010subcutaneous].

```

## Subcutaneous White Adipose Tissue (scWAT)
Subcutaneous White Adipose Tissue (scWAT) is including the upper (deep and shallow abdomen) and lower (gluteofemoral) body areas [@kwok2016heterogeneity]. Under physiological conditions, scWAT serves as a metabolically inert, long-term triglyceride storage site [@mcquaid2010femoral]. Acting as a buffer for excess energy, scWAT protects other organs from ectopic lipid deposition and contributes to specific metabolic benefits [@zwick2018anatomical]. This buffering role allows scWAT to mitigate the impact of excess dietary lipid consumption while also compensating for energy deficits during fasting, starvation, or strenuous exercise [@mcquaid2010femoral].

scWAT is composed predominantly of adipocytes, which constitute approximately 50% of its cellular content [@koenen2021obesity]. In addition to adipocytes, scWAT includes vascular cells, fibroblasts, adipocyte precursors, multipotent mesenchymal stem-like cells, nerve cells, and immune cells such as macrophages, lymphocytes, eosinophils, and mast cells. These components are embedded within an extracellular matrix that provides structural support [@koenen2021obesity]. Collectively, these cells secrete a wide array of signaling molecules, including adipokines such as leptin, adiponectin, and resistin, which play essential roles in maintaining metabolic homeostasis [@lopez2024unraveling].

## Metabolic Functions of WAT
The main role of white adipose tissue (WAT) is to manage energy balance by storing and releasing fatty acids (FAs) according to variations in energy availability [@lopez2024unraveling]. Furthermore, WAT produces a range of hormones and cytokines, collectively referred to as adipokines, which are crucial for regulating numerous physiological functions [@scherer2006adipose].

### Lipids Storage and Mobilization
WAT maintains energy balance by storing and releasing fatty acids (FAs), a process controlled by the interplay between lipogenesis and lipolysis. This equilibrium is essential for sustaining energy homeostasis during periods of fasting or exercise [@lopez2024unraveling]. In the [@fig-lopez2024unraveling2] shows these processes in more detail.

Lipogenesis is the process of synthesizing new lipids from excess glucose or dietary fatty acids. This process occurs in the cytoplasm of adipocytes and is tightly regulated by various hormones and enzymes [@song2018regulation]. Insulin, the key hormone involved in this process, facilitates the uptake of glucose and fatty acids into adipocytes and activates essential enzymes for lipid synthesis, including acetyl CoA-carboxylase (*ACC*) and fatty acid synthase (*FAS*) [@carpentier2021100th] ([@fig-lopez2024unraveling2]).

Lipolysis, on the other hand, is responsible for breaking down stored lipids in adipose tissue to release energy for peripheral organs. This process is particularly important during fasting or exercise when glucose levels are low, prompting the body to utilize stored fat for energy [@grabner2021lipolysis]. Lipolysis is regulated by lipases, which are activated by signals from the sympathetic nervous system, primarily mediated by norepinephrine, with some influence from epinephrine. The primary lipases involved include adipose triglyceride lipase (*ATGL*), hormone-sensitive lipase (*HSL*), and monoacylglycerol lipase (*MGL*) [@duncan2007regulation] ([@fig-lopez2024unraveling2]).

### Endocrine Function
Additionally, WAT secretes various hormones and cytokines, collectively known as adipokines, which play essential roles in regulating multiple physiological processes such metabolic, inflammatory, and immune processes throughout the body [@scherer2006adipose]. The endocrine function of WAT is influenced by nutritional status, physical activity, hormonal levels, and environmental signals, and is closely related to its metabolic and storage functions [@scheja2019endocrine]. The secretion products are shown in the [@fig-lopez2024unraveling2].

Current understanding of adipose tissue (AT)-derived adipokines encompasses over 100 proteins that interact with various cells and tissues [@lopez2024unraveling]. Leptin and adiponectin are the most characterized and well-studied adipokines. Leptin, the first adipokine to be discovered, has been shown to influence appetite and energy expenditure, serving as an important feedback mechanism to the brain regarding the size and condition of adipose tissue [@friedman2019leptin]. In contrast, adiponectin promotes insulin sensitivity and fatty acid oxidation in skeletal muscle and the liver, contributing to the maintenance of glucose and lipid homeostasis [@karbowska2006role].

Additionally, WAT releases extracellular vesicles (EVs), small membrane-bound particles containing various bioactive molecules such as microRNAs (miRNAs), proteins, and lipids. These EVs play a role in maintaining energy homeostasis both locally and systemically [@bond2022adipose; @kulaj2023adipocyte].

The endocrine activity of WAT is influenced by factors such as nutritional status, physical activity, hormonal levels, and environmental signals. Dysregulation of WAT function, as observed in obesity and metabolic disorders, can result in insulin resistance (IR), chronic inflammation, and various metabolic and cardiovascular complications [@jung2014obesity; @zorena2020adipokines].

## Dysregulation of Adipose Tissue and Its Implications
Under prolonged positive energy balance, a failure to expand AT mass via adipocyte hyperplasia (the formation of new adipocytes through precursor differentiation) results in adipocyte hypertrophy (an increase in cell size) [@jo2009hypertrophy]. This is a hallmark of AT dysfunction, as enlarged adipocytes have a diminished capacity to store excess dietary energy due to being already saturated with lipids [@stenkula2018adipose; @muir2016adipose].

As adipocytes grow in size, they experience increased mechanical stress due to enhanced contact with neighboring cells and components of the extracellular matrix [@lopez2024unraveling]. Additionally, adipocytes face hypoxia, as the hypertrophic expansion of adipose tissue outpaces angiogenesis [@trayhurn2013hypoxia]. Furthermore, hypertrophic adipocytes and damaged cells release pro-inflammatory cytokines, which recruit and activate immune cells. These factors collectively contribute to a chronic low-grade inflammatory state in adipose tissue, significantly impairing its functionality [@kawai2021adipose].

In individuals with obesity, enlarged adipocytes exhibit partial resistance to the antilipolytic effects of insulin [@lopez2024unraveling]. This increased lipolysis results in elevated levels of free fatty acids (FFAs) in the bloodstream, leading to ectopic lipid deposition and subsequent lipotoxicity. These disruptions can contribute to the onset of systemic insulin resistance, oxidative stress, and the progression of obesity-related comorbidities [@wondmkun2020obesity].

The functionality of scWAT is closely linked to body fat distribution [@lopez2024unraveling]. Under pathological conditions, its lipid-storage capacity becomes overwhelmed, leading to hypoxia, infiltration of pro-inflammatory macrophages, and ectopic fat accumulation in other tissues, such as the liver [@ipsen2018molecular]. These alterations disrupt the balance of adipokine secretion, fostering a pro-inflammatory state and systemic insulin resistance, hallmark features in patients with MASLD and related disorders [@ipsen2018molecular].

Understanding the mechanisms underlying scWAT dysfunction highlights the critical role of adipose tissue expandability in metabolic health. The ability of adipose tissue to appropriately expand in response to excess energy intake is crucial for maintaining metabolic homeostasis. When the expansion capacity is compromised, it contributes to the pathogenesis of various metabolic diseases, including MASLD.

## Adipose Tissue Expandability and Liver Fat Deposition
The adipose tissue expandability hypothesis is crucial for understanding MASLD. This hypothesis posits that the body's capacity to store excess calories in subcutaneous adipose tissue (scWAT) is limited and varies between individuals [@gray2007adipose]. Once scWAT reaches its maximum storage capacity, adipose tissue can no longer effectively store lipids, leading to the redistribution of lipids to other organs [@virtue2010adipose]. This results in ectopic fat accumulation, primarily in visceral adipose tissue (visWAT) and the liver, which contributes to insulin resistance and associated metabolic complications through mechanisms driven by lipotoxicity and inflammation [@lee2023adipocentric].

The disparity between energy intake and the storage capacity of adipose tissue is a critical factor in the onset of MASLD. When excessive caloric intake occurs, particularly in conjunction with the limited expandability of subcutaneous adipose tissue (scWAT), it results in fat accumulation in the liver. This hepatic fat buildup, known as steatosis, is a defining characteristic of MASLD and paves the way for additional liver damage [@lopez2024unraveling].

### Hepatic Response to Ectopic Fat Accumulation
In MASLD, hepatocytes are the primary cells impacted by ectopic fat deposition. The buildup of triglycerides in hepatocytes, initially serving as a protective mechanism against excess circulating free fatty acids, ultimately results in cellular stress and damage. This fact manifests in various ways:

-   *Inflammatory Response*: The accumulation of ectopic fat in the liver triggers an inflammatory response, attracting immune cells and producing pro-inflammatory cytokines. Chronic inflammation induces notable histological changes, that are critical for the progression of the disease from steatosis to MASH and fibrosis, and may also contribute to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) [@du2015association].

-   *Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) Stress*: The accumulation of lipids disrupts ER function in hepatocytes, triggering an unfolded protein response that further contributes to cellular stress and apoptosis [@zhang2014role].

-   *Oxidative Stress*: When lipid overflow exceeds the capacities of mitochondria and peroxisomes, respiratory oxidation becomes impaired, resulting in the generation of harmful metabolites and excess reactive oxygen species (ROS) [@wang2020mutual]. These reactive molecules cause oxidative stress, worsening necro-inflammatory processes in the liver and damaging mitochondria. ROS and oxidized low-density lipoproteins (LDL) activate Kupffer and hepatic stellate cells, leading to collagen deposition and secondary liver fibrosis [@delli2021oxidative; @paradies2014oxidative].

-   *Lipotoxicity*: Increased lipid levels, particularly saturated fatty acids and harmful lipid species such as diacylglycerol (DAG) and ceramide, lead to lipotoxic stress in hepatocytes, causing dysfunction and cell death [@alkhouri2009lipotoxicity].

-   *Altered Metabolism*: In a fatty liver, hepatocytes exhibit changes in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, often linked to insulin resistance. This exacerbates lipid accumulation and impairs liver function [@jacome2014fatty].

## miRNAs and Adipose Tissue Regulation
### miRNA biology, biogenesis and function
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a highly conserved family of small (21–25 nucleotides) noncoding RNAs [@wronska2015application; @lauressergues2015primary]. miRNAs are considered negative regulators of gene expression, functioning by either suppressing translation or promoting mRNA degradation through base pairing with complementary sequences in the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of protein-coding mRNA transcripts [@van2012microrna]. Notably, mRNA degradation constitutes the primary mechanism of miRNA activity [@guo2010mammalian]. miRNAs were first identified in *Caenorhabditis elegans* by Victor Ambros and Gary Ruvkun, who were awarded the 2024 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their groundbreaking work on miRNAs [@lee1993c; @wightman1993posttranscriptional; @calin20242024].

miRNAs have the ability to regulate hundreds of mRNA targets, and a single mRNA can be influenced by multiple miRNAs [@vienberg2017micro]. In the human genome, approximately 2,500 miRNAs have been identified [@alles2019estimate], with about 60% of protein-coding genes being regulated by miRNAs at the post-transcriptional level [@catalanotto2016microrna]. Due to this regulation ability, miRNAs are key regulators within complex genetic pathways, providing a post-transcriptional layer of control over homeostatic and developmental processes [@santulli2015microrna]. They play critical roles in a wide range of biological functions, including the regulation of the cell cycle, proliferation, lipid metabolism, inflammation, and fibrosis, among others [@yates2013long]. However, the dysregulation of miRNA has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several many diseases and metabolic disorders, including MASLD [@arrighetti2021mirnas; @ma2024micrornas; @gjorgjieva2019mirnas; @liu2015micro]. Specific miRNAs are known to be differentially expressed in metabolic tissues, including adipose tissue, in response to pathological states [@santulli2015microrna]. Their potential as biomarkers for disease progression and therapeutic targets has garnered significant interest in recent years [@arrighetti2021mirnas].

The biogenesis of miRNAs begins with the maturation of miRNAs occurs through a multi-step process that begins with transcription by RNA polymerase II [@bartel2004micrornas; @winter2009many]. This enzyme synthesizes single-stranded, non-protein-coding RNAs, which can be transcribed either as independent transcripts (intergenic miRNAs), often containing multiple miRNAs, or derived from the introns of protein-coding genes (intragenic or intronic miRNAs) [@santulli2015microrna]. The transcription of intergenic miRNAs produces primary miRNAs (pri-miRNAs) with a distinct hairpin or stem-loop structure and extends 1 kb or much longer, [@denli2004processing], resulting in a long primary transcript [@lee2004microrna] ([@fig-winter2009many]).

```{r, .r-stretch, fig.pos='H'}
#| fig-cap: "Canonical pathway of miRNA biogenesis and processing to mature miRNA. Image from Winter *et al.* [@winter2009many]" 
#| label: fig-winter2009many
setwd("~/Documentos/TFM/mirna_analysis/miRNA/TFM")
knitr::include_graphics("figures/winter2009many.png")
```

Then the pri-miRNA is cleaved by ribonulease III-type protein Drosha [@zeng2005recognition] and RNA binding protein DiGeorge Syndrome Critical Region 8 (DGCR8) [@shiohama2003molecular] in the nucleus to produce a \~70 nucleotide long hairpin structure named precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA). Pre-miRNAs are transported to the cytoplasm by exportin-5, where they are cleaved by the ribonuclease III enzyme Dicer in complex with TRBP. This cleavage removes the terminal hairpin structure and generates a \~22-nucleotide miRNA:miRNA\* duplex [@katahira2011nucleocytoplasmic].

The selection of one strand of the miRNA:miRNA\* duplex is influenced by the thermodynamic stability at the duplex ends [@bartel2004micrornas]. This duplex associates with an Argonaute (AGO) protein to form the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). The mature miRNA is generated when the miRNA\* strand is removed from the duplex. Generally, the strand with lower thermodynamic stability at its 5' end is preferentially loaded into an Argonaute protein (AGO). Notably, miRNA\* is not merely a byproduct of miRNA biogenesis; in many instances, it functions as a regulatory miRNA [@bhayani2012functional].

The loaded strand, referred to as the guide strand (miRNA), directs the miRNA-induced silencing complex (miRISC) to the mRNA target. In contrast, the unloaded strand, known as the passenger strand (miRNA\*), is unwound from the guide strand and subsequently degraded by cellular machinery [@o2018overview; @gebert2019regulation].

In addition, the diversity of miRNAs can lead to variations known as isomiRs, which arise from imprecise cleavage by Drosha and Dicer, 3' addition events, RNA editing, or single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) [@neilsen2012isomirs; @gebert2019regulation]. These isomiRs contribute to the functional complexity of the miRNA landscape, further expanding the regulatory potential of miRNAs and highlighting their importance in the intricate mechanisms of gene regulation.

### Mechanisms of miRNA-mediated gene regulation
The interaction between miRNAs and their target mRNAs forms a complex miRNA-mRNA interactome, where miRNAs bind to various regions of mRNAs. In the 3' untranslated region (3' UTR), miRNA binding typically induces transcript degradation or translation inhibition. Interactions in the 5' UTR and coding regions can also repress gene expression [@wahid2010micrornas]. Furthermore, miRNA binding to promoter regions may induce transcription, although this mechanism remains poorly understood [@o2018overview].

The classical mechanism of action of the miRNAs involves inhibiting gene expression by binding to complementary sequences, typically 6–8 nucleotides long, within the 3' untranslated region (3' UTR) of target mRNAs [@santulli2015microrna]. The miRNA strand loaded into Argonaute (AGO) proteins guides the miRNA-induced silencing complex (miRISC) to miRNA response elements (MREs) on the target mRNA. The outcome of this interaction depends on the degree of complementarity: perfect matches result in transcript degradation, whereas partial complementarity inhibits gene expression either through mRNA degradation or translation repression. Interestingly, some miRNAs can act independently of the miRISC complex. However, the mechanisms underlying these miRISC-free actions are not yet fully understood and warrant further investigation [@o2018overview; @wahid2010micrornas].

Due to the requirement for only a 6–8 nucleotide complementarity, a single miRNA can potentially target hundreds of mRNAs. Typically, one miRNA targets multiple mRNAs that are interconnected within the same metabolic pathway. This targeting capability allows miRNAs to regulate the expression of numerous other miRNAs, thereby contributing to a complex network of regulatory interactions [@lim2005microarray; @lv2013posttranscriptional]. In fact, most mammalian mRNAs are conserved targets of miRNAs [@friedman2009most]. Bioinformatic tools have become essential for predicting and validating miRNA-target interactions, facilitating the study of miRNA regulatory networks [@agarwal2015predicting; @chen2019trends].

### Association of miRNA with Hepatic Steatosis
miRNAs play a critical role in regulating key metabolic pathways in various liver cell types during the transition from steatosis to fibrosis, influencing processes such as lipid metabolism, oxidative stress, inflammation, and fibrosis [@gjorgjieva2019mirnas]. Throughout the progression of MASLD, miRNAs have been shown to be involved at every stage of the disease spectrum through diverse regulatory mechanisms [@ma2024micrornas]. This is of considerable intest providing that they could act as biomarkers of disease prognosis.

Acting as negative posttranscriptional regulators of gene expression, miRNAs also influence the expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism.

Given the critical role of miRNAs in regulating metabolic pathways in the liver, it is essential to explore those specific miRNAs are associated with hepatic steatosis. These miRNAs can be categorized according to their primary effects, allowing for a more detailed understanding of their involvement in this condition

### miRNAs as Biomarkers Based on Omics Sciences
The arrival of omics technologies has been essential in advancing precision medicine by providing an unprecedented ability to analyze complex biological systems. However, their contribution to the identification of clinically relevant biomarkers is often indirect, primarily due to the challenges associated with managing and interpreting largre datasets [@quezada2017omics]. According to the World Health Organization, a biomarker is defined as ‘‘any substance, structure, or process that can be measured in the body or its products and that can influence or predict the incidence or outcome of a disease’’ [@world2001biomarkers; @strimbu2010biomarkers]. Omics technologies, such as genomics, transcriptomics, and metabolomics, generate massive datasets that enable the discovery of molecules potentially associated with disease incidence, prognosis, or therapeutic response. This discovery process requires subsequent validation using established analytical techniques such as FISH, RT-PCR, PCR, or immunoaffinity assays before biomarkers can be approved for clinical use [@quezada2017omics]. Despite these complexities, the integration of omics data with clinical insights continues to unlock valuable opportunities for disease characterization and management.

The ability of a biomarker to provide a detailed characterization of a disease allows the stratification of patients into well-defined groups for tailored management and treatment, which forms the foundation of precision medicine [@biomarkers2001biomarkers]. Biomarkers can be categorized into four groups: diagnostic biomarkers, which identify a specific health condition in a patient; prognostic biomarkers, which help to chart the progression of a disease; predictive biomarkers, which suggest the expected response to a specific treatment; and predisposition biomarkers, which assess the likelihood of developing a particular illness [@biomarkers2001biomarkers;@quezada2017omics].

Among emerging biomolecules, miRNAs have gained significant attention as potential biomarkers [@biomarkers2001biomarkers]. These small non-coding RNA molecules are involved in critical cellular processes such as lipid metabolism, inflammation, and fibrosis, suggesting that they can serve as monitoring tools for various diseases, including metabolic dysfunction-associated diseases [@ma2024micrornas; @heyn2020impact]. miRNAs are primarily found in the cytoplasm, their presence has also been confirmed in circulatory system and various bodily fluids, including saliva and urine [@o2018overview]. This occurs due to processes such as cellular lysis, apoptotic body release, or active secretion. Their detection in biological fluids highlights their potential as non-invasive biomarkers for diseases such as MASH and MASLD [@carpi2024recent]. Their detection in biological fluids highlights their potential as non-invasive biomarkers for diseases such as MASH and MASLD [@carpi2024recent]. Circulating miRNAs can be categorized into three main types: (1) those enclosed within microvesicles, exosomes, or apoptotic bodies; (2) protein-associated miRNAs bound to RNA-binding proteins such as AGO2 or HDL; and (3) free-floating miRNAs [@o2018overview; @vienberg2017micro; ; @gareev2020current]. miRNAs have indeed been identified in adipocytes, which are considered a primary source of exosomal miRNAs [@a2011micrornas; @heyn2020impact]. This diversity underscores their biological and clinical significance.

A critical advantage of circulating miRNAs is their remarkable stability in extracellular environments. Their association with proteins or vesicles protects them from degradation by RNases, allowing for reliable detection [@schwarzenbach2014clinical]. Additionally, miRNAs exhibit high sensitivity and specificity in disease detection, and their measurement allows multiplex analyses, which further enhances diagnostic precision. However, challenges remain, such as variability in detection methods, the need for standardized protocols, and low miRNA abundance in some cases [@vienberg2017micro]. Addressing these barriers through advancements in absolute quantification methods, exosome-targeting strategies, and improved extraction techniques will be crucial for translating miRNA research into clinical applications [@gareev2020current].

Emerging evidence highlights the role of miRNAs in the pathogenesis of MASLD and its progression to MASH and HCC. Dysregulated miRNA expression in liver tissue and circulation has been linked to key pathways, including lipid metabolism, inflammation, fibrosis, and cell proliferation [@roy2022therapeutic]. For instance, miR-122 and miR-34a have been consistently identified as dysregulated in patients with MASLD, correlating with disease severity and progression [@carpi2024recent]. These findings suggest that miRNAs may serve as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers and even as therapeutic targets. However, knowledge gaps persist regarding the exact mechanisms by which miRNAs contribute to disease progression, particularly in MASH-related hepatocarcinogenesis. Further research is required to elucidate these pathways and establish causality.

In summary, miRNAs represent a transformative class of biomarkers with significant potential to reshape precision medicine. Their stability in extracellular conditions, combined with their presence in readily accessible fluids, makes them ideal candidates for non-invasive diagnostics and monitoring. Specific miRNA profiles may enable patient stratification and personalized treatment strategies, optimizing therapeutic efficacy while minimizing adverse effects. Advances in omics technologies, coupled with innovations in bioinformatics and analytical platforms, are expected to accelerate the integration of miRNAs into clinical practice.

The present study contributes to this growing field by combining bioinformatics analyses, in vitro models, and genetic manipulation to investigate miRNAs associated with hepatic steatosis in patients with obesity. By identifying miRNAs involved in lipogenesis, lipolysis, and $\beta$-oxidation, this research aims to uncover novel tools for preventing and treating metabolic disorders such as MASLD and MASH. Furthermore, the potential to use these miRNAs as non-invasive biomarkers or therapeutic targets represents a significant advancement in personalized medicine. This multidimensional approach not only expands our understanding of metabolic biology but also holds promise for direct clinical applications, ultimately improving the care of patients with obesity and associated liver diseases.
