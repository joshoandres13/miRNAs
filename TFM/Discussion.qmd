This study presents new insights about the role of miRNAs from subcutaneous adipose tissue in regulating metabolic processes related to hepatic steatosis. Through the analysis of smRNA-seq, differential miRNAs linked to key metabolic pathways were identified that may play a role in liver fat accumulation and the progression of hepatic steatosis in obese individuals. These findings address a critical gap in understanding the role of miRNAs in adipose-liver metabolic crosstalk, which has implications for targeted interventions in hepatic steatosis and bring new avenues for their eventual use as biomakers.

Previous studies have extensively investigated the role of miRNAs as potential biomarkers in MASLD and HCC, highlighting their regulatory functions in disease development and progression at various levels [@chrysavgis2024nafld; @carpi2024recent; @jin2012transition; @cotter2020nonalcoholic; @kloting2009microrna]. Among these, *miRNA-34a* and *miRNA-122* stand out as the most extensively studied in MASLD patients [@liu2018mirnas; @liu2016disease]. Furthermore, other miRNAs have also been associated with MASLD, as shown in studies by Liu et al., Gjorgjieva et al., and Szabo et al. [@liu2018mirnas; @gjorgjieva2019mirnas; @szabo2016role]. Notably, *miR-122-5p*, *miR-151a-3p*, *miR-126-5p*, and *miR-21-5p*  have been proposed as predictive biomarkers for assessing MASLD at different stages of dietary interventions [@tobaruela2024multipanel; @tobaruela2024circulating].

Beyond MASLD, miRNAs have been widely associated with other metabolic dysfunction-related disorders, including diabetes and T2DM [@ma2024micrornas]. For instance, tissue and circulating miRNAs have been identified as biomarkers of response to obesity treatment strategies in diseases such as diabetes [@catanzaro2021tissue].

Lastly, specific miRNAs have also been proposed as biomarkers in liver steatosis. Early studies identified miRNAs promising indicators of liver dysfunction [@roderburg2011micro], while others analyzed their expression in human omental and subcutaneous adipose tissue [@kloting2009microrna]. These findings emphasize the relevance of miRNAs not only in MASLD but also in broader contexts of metabolic and hepatic diseases.

In contrast to these previous studies, to our knowledge, our study is the first to identify differentially expressed miRNAs in subcutaneous with sm-RNA seq in scWAT from 78 obese individuals within the FATe cohort, which encompasses different scales of hepatic steatosis, and being validated *in vitro* through a model of human hepatocyte cells. Building on these insights, we specifically focused on identifying differentially expressed miRNAs associated with hepatic steatosis in subcutaneous adipose tissue to understand the direct relationship between hepatic steatosis and the expression of specific miRNAs in subcutaneous adipose tissue.  

Understanding the expression patterns of miRNAs across different tissues is essential for gaining deeper insights into both normal development and disease progression in these tissues [@ludwig2016distribution]. Adipose tissueâ€“liver crosstalk has been proposed to occur during MASLD, with factors originating from both adipose tissue and the liver identified as potential drivers of disease progression. Among these factors, miRNAs stand out, as their dysregulation in metabolic disturbances suggests a direct involvement in such conditions [@thomou2017adipose]. This highlights that alterations in miRNA signaling may play a role in obesity, metabolic syndrome, or MASLD.

*hsa-miR-372-3p* has been identified as a potent miRNA associated with tumorigenesis [@fan2020lncrna]. It has been shown to promote tumor formation in testicular germ cell tumors [@syring2015circulating; @murray2016present], lung cancer [@wang2017mir], parathyroid carcinoma [@fan2020lncrna], and osteosarcoma [@xu2018mir]. However, recent studies have highlighted the role of *hsa-miR-372-3p* in the context of MASH. Specifically, metabolic dysregulation leads to an increased expression of adipocyte enhancer binding protein 1 (*AEBP1*) in liver cells [@majdalawieh2006adipocyte]. Its emerging role in the formation of collagen-rich tissues and the development of tissue fibrosis is also significant in the context of MASH [@gerhard2019aebp1]. Also, *AEBP1* is a key component of a group of genes specifically dysregulated in the fibrotic processes associated with MASH [@ma2024micrornas]. Notably, the levels of *hsa-miR-372-3p* is found to be lower in patients with MASH and advanced fibrosis, where this miRNA interact functionally with *AEBP1* to reduce its expression. This suggests that the dysregulation of this miRNA may contribute to the progression of hepatic steatosis and its associated complications, further linking *hsa-miR-372-3p* to the metabolic dysregulation observed in MASH [@gerhard2019aebp1].

Through transcriptomic and pathway analysis, we predicted additional pathways already experimentally validated in which *hsa-miR-372-3p* is implicated. These pathways support its role in tumorigenesis, they also suggest a broader implication of *hsa-miR-372-3p* in metabolic disorders, particularly in processes associated with liver fat accumulation and fibrosis progression. One of these predicted pathways is the *PI3K-Akt signaling pathway*, which plays a central role in regulating cell survival, metabolism, and inflammation. Dysregulation of this pathway has been linked to MASLD, particularly in the context of insulin resistance and abnormalities in lipid metabolism [@zeng2024knockdown; @riaz2021inhibition]. Moreover, its downregulation in patients with advanced fibrosis suggests a potential regulatory role in the progression of hepatic steatosis to more severe conditions such as MASLD and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) [@gerhard2019aebp1; @fan2020lncrna; @thamjamrassri2022exploring]. This highlight a dual role for *hsa-miR-372-3p* in tumorigenesis and metabolic regulation. 

In this study, *hsa-mir-372-3p* was identified to be over-expressed in scWAT of obese patients with hepatic steatosis. However, it was significantly downregulated in MASH patients with advanced fibrosis compared to those with normal liver histology [@gerhard2019aebp1]. This change in expression underscores the potential role of *hsa-miR-372-3p* in the transition from simple steatosis to more severe liver conditions.

In our *in vitro* studies using HepG2 cells, the mimic of *hsa-miR-372-3p* downregulated the expression of *ACCA*, a key gene involved in lipogenesis. This finding aligns with the observed trends towards reduced mRNA levels of *FAS* and indicates a potential regulatory role of *hsa-miR-372-3p* in lipid metabolism. Although genes such as *DGAT2* and *PNPLA2* showed downregulation trends, they did not reach statistical significance, nor did *PPARG*, which remained unchanged.

These results suggest that *hsa-miR-372-3p* may influence hepatic lipid metabolism and contribute to the progression of hepatic steatosis, indicating its potential relevance in MASH pathogenesis. Although the result does not align with what might have been expected, the observed downregulation of key lipogenic genes, such as *ACCA* and *FAS*, reinforces the hypothesis that alterations in miRNA expression can significantly impact metabolic processes in the liver. *ACCA* is essential for converting acetyl-CoA into malonyl-CoA, a critical step in fatty acid synthesis, while FAS is responsible for synthesizing long-chain fatty acids. 

Interestingly, the downregulation of *ACACA* and *FAS* observed in our study could be partially mediated by the *PI3K-Akt pathway*, as this signaling cascade is closely tied to lipogenesis and lipid metabolism. This suggests a possible interaction between *hsa-miR-372-3p* and key metabolic signaling pathways, further underscoring its central role in hepatic lipid regulation.

*hsa-miR-372-3p* has been proposed as a regulatory miRNA in MASH [@kazemzadeh2024regulatory], and the observed downregulation of critical lipogenic genes highlights the need for further investigation into the functional implications of this miRNA and its targets in the context of liver disease. These findings also open avenues for therapeutic strategies targeting *hsa-miR-372-3p*, potentially providing a novel approach to managing lipid accumulation and fibrosis in MASLD.

*hsa-mir-144-3p* belongs to the *MIR-144* family, alongside its counterpart, the guide strand *hsa-mir-144-5p*. Although *hsa-mir-144-3p* is technically classified as the passenger strand, studies have demonstrated that it is often more abundant than the guide strand and plays a significant functional role in the organism [@sun2017e2f8]. This highlights the need to consider both strands when analyzing the biological impact of the *MIR-144* family. This miRNAs is typically secreted into the extracellular space [@rnacentral2017rnacentral] and is frequently expressed in liver pathology [@rowe2023role]. Furthermore, *MIR-144* has been implicated in the progression of various cancers [@kooshkaki2020mir]. In the context of liver-related metabolic diseases, these miRNAs have been associated with pathologies such as chronic hepatitis B and HCC [@rowe2023role; @zhao2021epigenetic].

In our analyses, *hsa-miR-144-3p* emerged as a differentially expressed miRNA, suggesting its relevance in the context of hepatic steatosis. Previous studies have reported that this miRNA is involved in the progression of insulin resistance, which is closely linked to the development of hepatic steatosis and other metabolic disorders [@ma2024micrornas]. Additionally, *hsa-miR-144-3p* has been shown to inhibit nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (*Nrf2*) expression and downstream antioxidant genes, which in turn reduces glucose consumption and exacerbates zinc-induced insulin resistance in HepG2 cells [@ye2023plasma]. 

Furthermore, previous studies found that the upregulation of *hsa-miR-144-3p* promotes hepatocyte proliferation by suppressing the expression of the *Txnip* gene (thioredoxin-interacting protein), which is involved in glucose metabolism and inhibition of cell proliferation. This suggests that this miRNA could play a crucial role in liver regeneration, making it a promising therapeutic target for hepatic steatosis and related conditions [@niitsu2023increased]. These findings indicate that *hsa-miR-144-3p* is involved in liver regeneration and gluconeogenesis, making it an interesting candidate for investigating its role in hepatic steatosis. Indeed, several studies have already described a causative role of this miRNA in liver steatosis/liver disease (@azzimato2021hepatic; @kennedy2021mast; @zhao2021epigenetic).

Through transcriptomic and pathway analysis, we predicted additional pathways that have been experimentally validated in which *hsa-miR-144-3p* is implicated. Among these pathways, the *FoxO signaling pathway* has been established as a fundamental regulator in hepatic metabolism for its interaction with CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha (*C/EBP*$\alpha$), a crucial regulator of adipogenesis. This highlights its relevance in metabolic homeostasis and preadipocyte differentiation and also related [@lin2022mir]. Indeed, this pathway have been associated with MASLD [@ramadan2022hepatoprotective].

Moreover, *hsa-miR-144-3p* is downregulated in patients with HCC [@zhao2021epigenetic]. Studies have reported that the suppression of this miRNA promotes proliferation and metastasis by targeting E2F transcription factor 3 (*E2F3*), an oncogene involved in the regulation of cell proliferation [@cao2014mir; @kooshkaki2020mir]. In our study, we found that the expression of *hsa-miR-144-3p* significantly decreases as the level of steatosis increases in scWAT, suggesting a potential link between this miRNA's regulatory function and the progression of hepatic metabolic disorders. These findings underscore the importance of *hsa-miR-144-3p* as a candidate for therapeutic targeting in HCC and related metabolic conditions.

Furthermore, inhibition of *hsa-miR-144-3p* led to an upregulation of its key genes involved in the regulation of lipid metabolism in HepG2 cells treated with oleic acid. While the expression levels of the evaluated targets displayed variations, the changes did not reach statistical significance, indicating that the influence of *hsa-miR-144-3p* on these genes might be constrained under the experimental conditions utilized. This suggests that, despite the potential regulatory role of hsa-miR-144-3p, the specific context and cellular environment can significantly impact its effectiveness in modulating gene expression.

The potential of *hsa-miR-144-3p* extends beyond its role in liver metabolism and cancer progression. It has been proposed as a promising therapeutic target and a diagnostic/prognostic tool in various cancers [@kooshkaki2020mir; @pu2018extracellular]. Specifically, Rowe et al. [@rowe2023role] suggest that hsa-miR-144 could serve as a valuable biomarker in blood, plasma, or serum for chronic hepatitis B. This highlights the versatility of *hsa-miR-144-3p* not only in understanding disease mechanisms but also in facilitating early diagnosis and targeted therapies, reinforcing its importance in both clinical and research settings.

One of the main strengths of this study lies in the use of smRNA-seq analysis to identify specific miRNAs scWAT, an innovative methodology that provides detailed and accurate information about their regulation compared to previous studies. Furthermore, this is the first study to differentially characterize miRNAs in a large cohort of 78 patients with obesity. The identification of *hsa-miR-372-3p* and *hsa-miR-144-3p* as key regulators in metabolic pathways related to lipogenesis and the progression of hepatic steatosis, along with their functional validation in *in vitro* models, reinforces the biological and clinical relevance of the findings. This approach also provides new insights into the metabolic interaction between scWAT and the liver, highlighting the potential of these miRNAs as biomarkers and therapeutic targets in the management of obesity and its hepatic complications.

Despite these strengths, the study has several limitations. First, a greater representation of the later stages of steatossi progression would strengthen the findings, as although the number of volunteers is significant, the number of severe cases is relatively low. Nevertheless, a sample of 80 individuals is robust and provides solid statistical power. Second, while HepG2 cells served as a convenient model for our in vitro studies, their limitations in fully mimicking adipose-liver cross-talk restrict the scope of our findings. An adipocyte model could have provided a more physiologically relevant system for studying the interplay between *hsa-miR-144-3p* and *hsa-miR-372-3p* and metabolic pathways. However, due to time constraints, this alternative was not feasible within the framework of this study. Future research should address these limitations by incorporating diverse cellular models and larger datasets to strengthen the generalizability and applicability of our conclusions.

This study highlights the role of miRNAs expressed in adipose tissue in the regulation of metabolic processes related to hepatic steatosis. We identified *hsa-miR-372-3p* and *hsa-miR-144-3p* as key regulators in metabolic pathways such as lipogenesis and confirmed their functional impact *in vitro* models of hepatocytes. These findings reinforce their potential as biomarkers and therapeutic targets for the management of obesity and its hepatic complications.
